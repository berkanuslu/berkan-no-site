Hello there! I’m Berkan Uslu, a self-taught hobbyist street and travel photographer based in Oslo, Norway.

When I’m not programming, I usually go out with one of my cameras. Photography is one of my biggest passions. I’m fascinated by the energy and vibrancy of the city and love capturing the raw moments that often go unnoticed. From bustling markets to quiet alleys, there’s always something new to discover and capture.

I believe photography is the perfect excuse to be outside and explore new things. Immersing myself in new cultures, meeting new people, and visiting new places makes me happy. Photography allows me to witness moments about people and capture memories, whether in film or digital. I always love embracing the journey, not the destination!

Check out my gallery to join me on this visual journey!
